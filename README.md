# DocMen
*DocMentor* is a platform connecting medical students (Undergraduate and Postgraduate) with experienced doctors for mentorship in their chosen fields. It handles everything from finding the right advisor, scheduling sessions, and processing payments to ensure a secure and reliable experience. Acting as intermediaries, we charge a platform fee to the mentoring party, protecting both sides from scams, missed appointments, and unmet expectations.

Key features include:
- Real-time appointment scheduling, notifications, and rescheduling protocols.
- Secure payment processing with platform fees and money-back guarantees.
- Strict privacy protocols ensuring  confidential communication for sensitive data.
- AI-driven session regulation to monitor agreements and ensure accountability.
- Dispute resolution for handling refunds and missed promises.

The platform will be tentatively built using *Flutter* and *NoSQLÂ databases*.
